## TTC Next v2.0

TTC Next v2 is a web application that provides real-time information about the TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) subway system. It is a single-page application that uses [UMO open data API](https://retro.umoiq.com/service/publicJSONFeed) to display the current status of the buses/stree car lines, and estimated arrival time (ETA) for the next vehicle at a given stop number.

## What's new in v2.0

- Rebuilt with Next.js & Radix UI
- Redux + SWR integration
- Simplified click-and-search flow

## How to run the app

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to use the app

- Enter the stop number in the search bar and click on the search button
- Bookmark the specific route inside this stop
- Check the ETA before you leave your home/office

Pro tip: If itâ€™s practical, consider taking the car. ðŸš—

## Development Decisions

I decided to switch from server actions to API routes for a smoother debugging experience. With API routes, I can easily track requests and responses through the browserâ€™s network tab, making troubleshooting much more efficient.

Server actions, on the other hand, felt like a bit of a black boxâ€”when things went wrong, it was hard to trace the issue. Since this project only interacts with public external services, thereâ€™s no need to hide anything from the client side, making API routes the ideal choice here.

This switch results in faster debugging, clearer insights, and an overall better development flow.

P.S.1: I still use server actions for production-level projectsâ€”just not for this one.
